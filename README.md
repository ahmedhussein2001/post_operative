I use Classification ML model to automate decision-making based on patient data to predict whether a patient will be discharged or needs further care.

Column Descriptions:
L-CORE – Core body temperature (e.g., low, normal, high).
L-SURF – Surface body temperature (e.g., low, normal, high).
L-O2 – Oxygen saturation level (e.g., good, excellent, bad).
L-BP – Blood pressure level (e.g., low, normal, high).
SURF-STBL – Surface temperature stability (e.g., stable, unstable).
CORE-STBL – Core temperature stability (e.g., stable, unstable).
BP-STBL – Blood pressure stability (e.g., stable, unstable).
COMFORT – Patient comfort level (e.g., low, medium, high).
decision ADM-DECS – The final decision about patient discharge (e.g., sent home, admitted, recommended for follow-up).
