# 🏥 Post-Operative Patient Classification

## 📍 Overview
This project focuses on classifying the condition of patients after surgery using a medical dataset. The goal is to predict the postoperative recovery status (e.g., normal, serious, critical) based on several clinical indicators using machine learning models.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess real-world postoperative patient data.
- Explore the relationships between features (e.g., blood pressure, heart condition, etc.).
- Build classification models to predict patient status post-surgery.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM)

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, converting categories.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding feature relationships.
3. **Model Training** – Classification using multiple algorithms.
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📊 Sample Output
```bash
Model: Decision Tree
Accuracy: 92%
Classification Report:
- Normal: Precision = 0.94, Recall = 0.91
- Serious: Precision = 0.89, Recall = 0.93
- Critical: Precision = 0.90, Recall = 0.89
